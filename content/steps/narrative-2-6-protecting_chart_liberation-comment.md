body_en: For example, the russian media exclusively use the word “liberated”
  when referring to the territories occupied by the russian military. Thus,
  propaganda, through linguistic manipulation, tries to soften the statements,
  speaking allegorically about the war and distorting the meanings of the events
  taking place.
