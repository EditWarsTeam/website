body_en: Russian propaganda throws in such fakes, but they do not live long. The
  fictitious plot does not develop in any way and lacks details. There is no
  intelligible confirmation of the facts described by the defense ministry. In
  the case of propaganda work, they are not needed. Nevertheless, the media do
  not resort to disinformation as often as misinformation - this is the primary
  propaganda tool.
