body_en: Another surge in the topic of nuclear weapons usage and world war is
  associated with the RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental missile testing and the
  world's reaction to the nuclear threat from Russia. The media presented the
  response as hysterical - supposedly, the world was frightened. The media
  reproduces the assertion that Russia is assertive regarding nuclear potential
  and, if desired, can destroy opponents. However, despite its power, Russia
  does not want this war and considers a strike from a defensive position.
