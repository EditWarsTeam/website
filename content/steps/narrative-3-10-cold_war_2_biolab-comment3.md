body_en: However, this topic is not a new invention of Russian propaganda, and
  this fake was invented back in Soviet times. In the 1980s, the KGB
  disseminated information about Pakistan's biological laboratories. Published
  materials of this kind were picked up by TASS and reprinted in the Soviet
  press, thus obscuring topics about the actions of the Soviet army in
  Afghanistan.
