body_en: The topic of nuclear war is also being vigorously discussed in the
  media in connection with the intention of Sweden and Finland to join the NATO
  bloc, namely that the North Atlantic Alliance cannot guarantee the
  non-deployment of nuclear weapons in these countries. It is noteworthy that
  the reaction of the Russian media to the statement of the Assistant Secretary
  General of NATO and individual comments by former European politicians
  regarding the transfer of nuclear weapons to Ukraine was disproportionate and
  excessively painful.
