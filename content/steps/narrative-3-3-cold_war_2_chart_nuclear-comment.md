  This statement firmly hooked the Russian media, and they actively reproduced
  the Ukrainian nuclear status threat topic during the week before February 24
  and the week after.\

  The media presented the news as Ukraine’s “plans'' or “desires” to have the status of nuclear power as an end in itself. However, Zelensky’s statement initially had the context of a forced reaction to the lack of security guarantees from the nuclear powers.
