Originally, it was the name for members of the \"Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\" faction, which was led by Stepan Bandera from 1940 to 1959. But already in the USSR, this word was often used in Soviet propaganda. The concept of \"Bandera\" in the USSR gradually became a household word. Later, the term took an important place in Russian political propaganda and is used with a negative connotation. Step by step, members of any power and law enforcement agencies of Ukraine began to be called \"Banderites\", regardless of their attitude towards nationalism. Such a uniform interpretation of history became the basis for accusing the authorities of supporting neo-Nazism and creating the image of an enemy.","body_ru":"","name":"mythical-nazis-6-DefaultText","uuid":"24f18dc9-290d-57cf-9281-0cf443c079f1","chart_comment":""}
