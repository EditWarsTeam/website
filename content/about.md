  Edit Wars is a project using the analysis of media publications accompanying
  the growing militarization and manipulation of mass consciousness in Russia
  for a better understanding of the mechanics of state propaganda and ways to
  build resilience towards it. The project focus on the use of aggressive
  narratives in the government-controlled media that isolate public perception
  from the real state of affairs


  The project consists of two parts. The research combines the use of quantitative and qualitative methods of working with data from large datasets to draw meaningful conclusions for the presentation. The artistic part of the project aims to put the findings into a multimedia interactive medium. 


  We are open to partnerships with publishers, media and fact-checking organizations.

  * To deconstruct Russian propaganda narratives through data research

  * To create data analysis tools for the content investigation of the headlines in Russian online media

  * To study the dynamics of the use of thematic markers, the presence of propaganda narratives in the headlines, as well as the temporal relationship between events and their media coverage

  * To promote critical thinking and build resilience to misinformation and its reproduction.

  * To develop artistic interpretation and embodiment of the research insights to offer new ways of perceiving the material.

  The first iteration of the project is based on data analysis of propaganda
  narratives created and reproduced by the Russian digital media from January to
  July 2022. By using GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases, we analyzed
  more than 250,000 newsheaders of Russian-language media publications. We used
  machine learning tools (in particular, the BERTopic algorithm) to thematically
  clusterize data and to obtain relevant topics with the dynamics of their
  change. Additionally, we also applied Tableau to discover typical words and
  phrases of propaganda. Finally, we extracted word connections in headlines and
  visualized the resulting network graph using Spacy library.\

  The methodology we developed allows us to replicate the results of our study and contains algorithms for working with the data. We encourage stakeholders to use it as a basis for their own research on propaganda narratives.
