  Edit Wars is a project using the analysis of media publications accompanying
  the growing militarization and manipulation of mass consciousness in Russia
  for a better understanding of the mechanics of state propaganda and ways to
  build resilience towards it. The project focus on the use of aggressive
  narratives in the government-controlled media that isolate public perception
  from the real state of affairs


  The project consists of two parts. The research combines the use of quantitative and qualitative methods of working with data from large datasets to draw meaningful conclusions for the presentation. The artistic part of the project aims to put the findings into a multimedia interactive medium. 


  The project is aimed at an internationally wide audience interested in the specifics and potential threats of Russian propaganda, its mechanisms of persuasion and methods of influencing audiences within the country. The project may be of interest to researchers of media freedom in authoritarian regimes and the consequences of the monopolisation of the information space. The results of the study may be of practical interest as a tool for debunking propaganda myths.


  We are open to partnerships with publishers, media and fact-checking organizations.
