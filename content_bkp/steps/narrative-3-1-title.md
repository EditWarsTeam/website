body_en: The threat of world war and nuclear weapons is one of the critical
  topics of propaganda and is used as a reaction to foreign policy challenges.
  If, at the beginning of the year, the joint statement of the nuclear five
  countries has a positive connotation in the media - diplomatic success, Russia
  provides security guarantees for all states - then in the future, this topic
  becomes the subject of blackmail and justification for Russia's actions in the
  international arena.
